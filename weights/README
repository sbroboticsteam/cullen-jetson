READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY

The weights file of a yolov3 network is simply a serial file with a bunch of floats
This means reading and writing it is very precise.
The format of these weights files are as follows:

The weights contained belong only to a Batch Norm or Conv layer
These weights are stored in an order exactly the same as the cfg file
Within a convolutional block, there can be a batch norm layer
When there is not, bias must be read from the file

Note as well that the first 160 bytes of the file store 5 int32 values:
1. Major version #
2. Minor version #
3. Subversion #
4,5. Images seen by network during training
These are the headers of the file
The rest of the bits are float32 values
