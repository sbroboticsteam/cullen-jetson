Keras Implementation of YOLOv3

# Requirements:
Python 3.6
Keras
Tensorflow
OpenCV
Numpy
and others

# Steps
Download the weights file from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights to the weights folder.

Run python convert.py to generate the yolo model converted from darknet to Keras.

Run python 
detect.py to get check if it works.

detect.py will load the model and start making predictions.
